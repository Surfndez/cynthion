Cynthion Project Description
============================

Cynthion is an all-in-one tool for building, testing, monitoring, and experimenting with USB devices. Built around a unique FPGA-based architecture, Cynthion’s digital hardware can be fully customized to suit the application at hand. As a result, it can act as a no-compromise High-Speed USB protocol analyzer, a USB-hacking multi-tool, or a USB development platform.

Out-of-the-box, Cynthion acts as a USB protocol analyzer capable of capturing and analyzing traffic between a host and any Low-, Full-, or High-Speed ("USB 2.0") USB device. It works seamlessly with our `Packetry <https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/packetry>`__ open-source analysis software.

Combined with our `LUNA <https://luna.readthedocs.io>`__ gateware and `Facedancer <https://facedancer.readthedocs.io>`__ libraries, Cynthion becomes a versatile USB-hacking and development tool. Facedancer makes it quick and easy to create or tamper with real USB devices—not just emulations—even if you don’t have experience with digital hardware design, HDL, or FPGA architecture!
